# 📊 Population Health Management (PHM) Power BI Dashboard

## 🏥 Project Overview
This project aims to develop a **Population Health Management (PHM) Dashboard** using **Power BI** to analyze health data, track trends, and improve healthcare outcomes. The dashboard provides insights into **chronic diseases, mental health, maternal and child health, infectious diseases, and health disparities** using key healthcare data sources.

## 📌 Features
- **Health Needs Analysis**: Chronic diseases, mental health, maternal & child health, infectious diseases.
- **Data Source Integration**: EHRs, claims data, public health records, surveys, social determinants of health.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Disease prevalence, healthcare utilization, cost analysis, patient satisfaction.
- **Interactive Visuals**: Charts, maps, and trend analysis for better decision-making.

## 📊 Data Sources
- **Electronic Health Records (EHRs)**: Patient demographics, diagnoses, treatments.
- **Claims Data**: Healthcare utilization, cost analysis.
- **Public Health Data**: Disease prevalence, vaccination rates.
- **Patient Surveys**: Satisfaction scores, patient-reported outcomes.
- **Social Determinants of Health (SDOH)**: Income, housing, education, access to care.
- **Health Information Exchanges (HIEs)**: Shared patient care records.

## 📌 Dashboard Metrics
- **Chronic Diseases**: Diabetes (HbA1c levels), hypertension (blood pressure control rates).
- **Mental Health**: Access to care, prevalence of depression & anxiety.
- **Maternal & Child Health**: Birth outcomes, prenatal care access.
- **Infectious Diseases**: Vaccination rates, disease incidence.
- **Health Disparities**: Data by race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status.
